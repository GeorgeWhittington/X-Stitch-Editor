# X-Stitch-Editor

A Cross Stitch pattern editor built with nanogui.

## Running instructions

Install Cmake, and any build tools you need on your system to compile c++. Create a folder inside the root directory called build, and cd into it. Run the commands `cmake ..` and then `make`.

NOTE: I have only tested the functionality of the GPU kernels for MacOS, specifically on an M1 machine. This application may not yet work as intended on other devices.
